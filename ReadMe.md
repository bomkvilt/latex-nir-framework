# Texworks

This is together a build system for LaTeX projects and LaTeX libraries that form an environment to 
-   form tree-structured projects with relative includes (like it's possible in general 
    programming languages), 
-   shortcuts to atchive resources avaliable to a specific node (documents, equation, images),
-   

The build tool allows to:
-   generate build directories and special autogenerated files,
-   convert MathType equations to LaTeX 


The tool is made to parse command-line arguments to perform specific actions:
 1. [ModuleManager](<modules/module_manager.py>) gets constructed and starts to connect submodules 
    and ask them to add commands they support to a command tree.
    Then the commands start to be atchived on pathes:
    ```
    <module_name> command [subcommands] [required_args] [--flags] [optional_args=]
    ```
 2. The Manager add it's own commands to the command tree.
 3. All modules are subclasses of a [ModuleBase class](<modules/module_base.py>) and contains 
    references to the ModuleManager that allow to take required modules by the module Type.
    This a mechanism a ***direct module communication***.
 4. Also, it's possible to use the ModuleManager's ***command-line-arguments mechanism***.
    In this the communication will be simular to a sending of the arguments from a console.
    This mechanism allows to create build scripts.

## The most common actins

| command | action |
| ---     | ---    |
| `python control.py init`                        | Init build system's modules and perform project-level code generation actions
| `python control.py type2tex <module_name> [-f]` | Generate LaTeX equations that available from a module 'module_name'
| `python control.py build <doc_name> --mode=raw --steps=N`    | Build a document <doc_name> without a 'dump' optimisation tencology and then perform 'N' latex compiler passes
| `python control.py build <doc_name> --mode=PCH --steps=N -f` | Build a document <doc_name> with use of a 'dump' build optimisation tencology and then perform 'N' latex compiler passes. If '-f' dump will be rebuilt
| `python control.py build clear <doc_name>`      | Clear build directory except specific files
